# sourdough-calculator

Calculate the water amount needed for making sourdough usually for bread - based on starter amount, flour amount and desired hydration percentage. Assuming that starter is made of 100% hydration (same amount of water and flour).

## Starter weight
Total amount of starter in grams - usually a combination of water and flour

## Flour weight
The total amount of flour you want to use in grams

## Desired percentage
Desired percentage of sourdough hydration

## Water amount
The amount of water in grams that needs to be added to achieve the desired percentage of hydration of the sourdough. Assuming that starter is made of 100% hydration (same amount of water and flour).
